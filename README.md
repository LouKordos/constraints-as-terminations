## About this repository

This repository contains an Isaaclab implementation of the article **CaT: Constraints as Terminations for Legged Locomotion Reinforcement Learning** by Elliot Chane-Sane\*, Pierre-Alexandre Leziart\*, Thomas Flayols, Olivier Stasse, Philippe Souères, and Nicolas Mansard.

This implementation was built by Constant Roux and Maciej Stępień.

This paper has been accepted for the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024).

This code relies on the [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) library and [IsaacLab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/v1.4.1/index.html) (version 1.4.1).

Implementation of the constraints manager and modification of the environment can be found in the [CaT directory](exts/cat_envs/cat_envs/tasks/utils/cat/). The modified PPO implementation can be found in the [CleanRL directory](exts/cat_envs/cat_envs/tasks/utils/cleanrl/).

`ConstraintsManager` follows the manager-based Isaac Lab approach, allowing easy integration just like other managers. For a full example, check out [cat_flat_env_cfg.py](exts/cat_envs/cat_envs/tasks/locomotion/velocity/config/solo12/cat_flat_env_cfg.py).

```python
@configclass
class ConstraintsCfg:
    # Safety Soft Constraints
    joint_torque = ConstraintTerm(
        func=constraints.joint_torque,
        max_p=0.25,
        params={"limit": 3.0, "names": [".*_HAA", ".*_HFE", ".*_KFE"]},
    )
    # Safety Hard Constraints
    contact = ConstraintTerm(
        func=constraints.contact,
        max_p=1.0,
        params={"names": ["base_link", ".*_UPPER_LEG"]},
    )
```


## Running CaT (fork, follow this)

### Training and Isaac Lab Simulation

Training and isaac lab related tasks were tested without docker, by using `create-isaac-lab-env-uv.py`. Check the slurm config and the `justfile` for available commands, as well as the `scripts` directory.

## Sim2Real
For deploying on the real robot, the `sim2real` directory is relevant. It uses docker containers for ROS and you should build and run using `build-and-run.sh`. Check the options inside the script. 

NOTE: `build-and-run.sh` is responsible for building both the docker container and the actual code base, so you simply run it after cloning once and then inside the container again. Run `xhost +local:docker` on the host (outside docker) if GUI applications do not open properly from within the docker container.

For communication with Go2, you need to `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0` and source the workspace (as the docker bashrc already tells you to). Also set up your network and ensure you can ping the robot: [https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/Quick_start](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/developer/Quick_start). You should be able to run the code on either your workstation connected to the Go2 via Ethernet, or the Go2 itself. However, it is recommended to run as much as possible on the actual robot and only visualizations or plotting on the workstation for latency and EMI reasons. 

**Ensure the time between Go2 and your workstation are synced!** This is crucial for the ROS computations to work properly:
1. On workstation connected to Go2: Add `allow 192.168.123.0/24` in `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf`
2. Allow NTP through the firewall (if enabled)
3. On the Go2: Add `server [YOUR_WORKSTATION_IP] iburst prefer minpoll 0 maxpoll ` to `/etc/chrony/chrony.conf`
4. Confirm time is sufficiently accurate using `chronyc tracking`

**DO NOT SOURCE THE ROS INSTALLATION OR WORKSPACE BEFORE RUNNING** `build-and-run.sh`! This will cause CycloneDDS issues, likely because the RMW installed for ROS and the version used by the Go2 SDK are different. For this reason, the actual policy inference code `run_policy.cpp` has been kept separate from any ROS dependencies. For data collection, the `build-and-run.sh` script already records the available robot states into a rosbag, only the actions generated by the policy are not being recorded.

There are two workspaces created by `bootstrap_ros2_ws.sh`, one is for using [https://github.com/inria-paris-robotics-lab/go2_odometry](https://github.com/inria-paris-robotics-lab/go2_odometry) and the other for [https://github.com/Unitree-Go2-Robot/go2_robot](https://github.com/Unitree-Go2-Robot/go2_robot). **DO NOT SOURCE BOTH WORKSPACES AT THE SAME TIME** AND DO NOT RUN `go2_bringup` AT THE SAME TIME AS `go2_odometry`! This is subject to change as the code base has been switched to vicon and FastLIO2, so there will only be one workspace present after those changes.

To set up the MID360 LIDAR (used for elevation mapping and Fast-LIO2 LIDAR-inertial odometry), ensure the lidar is on the same subnet as the robot (`192.168.123.xxx`, can be done with [Livox Viewer 2](https://www.livoxtech.com/downloads)) and that you can ping it. Then, ensure data readouts work properly using [Livox Viewer 2](https://www.livoxtech.com/downloads).

### Network configuration
There might be connectivity issues between workstation and robot depending on how your network interfaces are set up:
1. Adjust the network interface used in `cyclone_config.xml` => set `export CYCLONEDDS_URI=file://[PATH_TO_PROVIDED_CYCLONEDDS_CONFIG_IN_THIS_REPO]`
2. Ensure you have a multicast route on the network interface being used for robot communication (e.g. using `sudo ip route add 224.0.0.0/4 dev [YOUR_NETWORK_INTERFACE]`)
3. Check `MULTICAST` shows up for the network interface you are using under `ip link show`
3. Ensure `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`
3. `ros2 daemon stop && ros2 daemon start`
To check if everything is set up properly: 
1. Ensure `ros2 multicast send` on workstation results in a received message when running `ros2 multicast receive` on the Go2. 
2. Check if `ros2 topic echo /lowstate` and other topics are printing out the robot's state correctly, or at least receiving messages.

### Run the policy
**Important:** If you run the ROS nodes first, this will cause issues. The Unitree Go2 publishes odometry and some other topics only when high level control mode is enabled (low level control mode **disabled**), and disables them once you want to control the actuators directly. Follow the steps below to set everything up:

1. **In a new terminal without ROS sourced**: Run `build-and-run.sh` inside the docker container as a first step, press enter and wait for it to enter low level control mode, so that the robot disables the publishers for these topics. Ensure the robot is standing in place for a few seconds at least.
3. Adjust `/app/odom_alternative_ws/src/third_party/livox_ros_driver2/config/MID360_config.json` and `/app/ros2_ws/src/third_party/livox_ros_driver2/config/MID360_config.json` to specify the correct host IP (onboard Jetson or workstation), as well as the LIDAR IP address.
4. Change extrinsics in `/app/odom_alternative_ws/src/go2_livox_bringup/launch/livox.launch.py` depending on how and where you mounted the lidar on top of the robot. This will create a static transform publisher to define where the lidar is relative to the base link
6. In a second terminal (for all steps below), run `bootstrap_ros2_ws.sh` again.
3. `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0` so that Go2 topics become visible
4. `source /app/odom_alternative_ws/install/setup.bash`
4. Ensure you see `/lowstate` and under `ros2 topic list`
5. Run `ros2 launch go2_livox_bringup bringup.launch.py | grep -v "Failed to parse type hash for topic"`. Note that you can pass `use_vicon:=True` to replace odometry with vicon motion tracking. This requires a tf publisher using something like [https://github.com/dasc-lab/ros2-vicon-bridge](https://github.com/dasc-lab/ros2-vicon-bridge).
7. Open rviz2 and ensure `/tf` and the `/odom` frame work properly.
6. Inspect `/tf`, livox pointcloud, robot model, odometry in RViz2 on workstation.

### Elevation Mapping
This is a WIP, I will add more detailed instructions when everything is working properly. A future refactoring will combine all packages into a single ros workspace, including the main policy inference and FastLIO2 and any other dependencies, so that only a single launch file needs to be run and the rest starts up automatically. However, for the time being clone my [fork](https://github.com/LouKordos/elevation_mapping_cupy/tree/ros2_humble) **and `git checkout ros2_humble`**, then build the docker container. Inside the docker shell:

1. `export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`
2. `export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0`
3. `ros2 topic list` to ensure that you see all the robot topics. If not, refer to steps above ("Network configuration")
4. Ensure odometry is running correctly
4. `./src/elevation_mapping_cupy/docker/build.sh && source install/setup.bash && ros2 launch elevation_mapping_cupy elevation_mapping_go2.launch.py use_python_node:=false`
